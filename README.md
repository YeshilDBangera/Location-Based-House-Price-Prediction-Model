This repository contains a machine learning project that uses linear regression to predict the prices of houses in Boston. The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which is a well-known dataset that is often used for regression tasks.

The project is implemented using Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. The Jupyter notebook provided in the repository contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

#Getting Started

To run the project, you will need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. The recommended way to install the required libraries is through the use of a virtual environment. Once you have set up a virtual environment.

#Results

The linear regression model was able to achieve a mean squared error of 21.51 on the test set, indicating that the model is able to make accurate predictions. The project also includes a brief analysis of the model's performance and the important features that have a significant impact on the housing prices.

#Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of linear regression for predicting the prices of houses in Boston. The model is able to make accurate predictions and the project also provides insights into the factors that impact housing prices. This project can serve as a good starting point for further experimentation and improvement. Additionally, the project also includes a web application and an API, and been deployed on a Heroku platform using Docker.
